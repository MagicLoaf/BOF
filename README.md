# BOF
A battle simulator for the best of frenemies

This is a personal project to see if I can make lore accurate characters for my friends and check who will win it all!! 

To have a fair contest, every character will have a total of 720 value points to use in their stats, any other total number will be consider either illegal or underpowered

Created by yours trully MagicLoaf-The multiverse is my kitchen, and this is my oven!

To make a frienemy outside of the program, you'll need a text file with the name of the frienemy and this layout:

{
    “name”: “0”,
    “hp”: 0,
    “attack”: 0,
    “defense”: 0,
    “sp_attack”: 0,
    “sp_defense”: 0,
    “speed”: 0,
    “moves”: [
        “TM000”,
        “TM000”,
        “TM000”,
        “TM000”
    ]
}

remember to give it a name, change the 0 to the values you want, and the TMs are currently up to TM050
